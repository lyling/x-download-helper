# x-download-helper

Download proxy. Replace remote resources(files, binary-stream etc) to local. To speed up download for specified purpose, like game data download.

It is inspired from https://github.com/KOPElan/PSX-Download-Helper and https://github.com/harryi3t/psx-download-helper-nodejs.

This project using golang to develop just for my learning go practices. And I hope it can be used at PSX, Xbox, NS etc. 

So I name it ```x-download-helper```, x for any.
